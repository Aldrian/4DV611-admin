#### `gulp/server.js`

The generator ship a fully featured development server through the use of [Browser Sync](http://www.browsersync.io/). Don't hesitate to look at its website to know more about all its features and options.

The `serve` task has as only goal to configure and launch it.

#### Browser Sync configuration

The base directories for Browser Sync are `.tmp/serve` and `src` with a priority for `.tmp/serve`. The processed version of a file has to be chosen over the source one.

As the `bower_components` folder is not located in any of the base paths, a special routes is added for this folder to be addressed by `/bower_components`.

The default Browser Sync port is `3000`, if you ever need to change it, head over to the [gulp/server.js](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular/blob/master/generators/app/templates/gulp/_server.js#L42) file and add the `port` attribute to the *server* variable.
Example below :
```javascript
browserSync.instance = browserSync.init({
    startPath: '/',
    server: server,
    browser: browser,
    port: 4000 // Add this line to change the default port
  });
```

Last configuration, the `browser` option is used to open the default browser to the root page.

Head over to [Browser Sync list of options](http://www.browsersync.io/docs/options/) for the full list of available configurations for BrowserSync.

#### Use Gulp tasks

* `gulp` or `gulp build` to build an optimized version of your application in `/dist`
* `gulp serve` to launch a browser sync server on your source files
* `gulp serve:dist` to launch a server on your optimized application
* `gulp test` to launch your unit tests with Karma
* `gulp test:auto` to launch your unit tests with Karma in watch mode
* `gulp protractor` to launch your e2e tests with Protractor
* `gulp protractor:dist` to launch your e2e tests with Protractor on the dist files

More information on the gulp tasks in the [User Guide](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular/blob/master/docs/user-guide.md).
#### Features included in the gulpfile
* *useref* : allow configuration of your files in comments of your HTML file
* *ngAnnotate* : convert simple injection to complete syntax to be minification proof
* *uglify* : optimize all your JavaScript
* *csso* : optimize all your CSS
* *autoprefixer* : add vendor prefixes to CSS
* *rev* : add a hash in the file names to prevent browser cache problems
* *watch* : watch your source files and recompile them automatically
* *eslint* : The pluggable linting utility for JavaScript
* *imagemin* : all your images will be optimized at build
* *Unit test (karma)* : out of the box unit test configuration with karma
* *e2e test (protractor)* : out of the box e2e test configuration with protractor
* *browser sync* : full-featured development web server with livereload and devices sync
* *angular-templatecache* : all HTML partials will be converted to JS to be bundled in the application
* **TODO** lazy : don't process files which haven't changed when possible
